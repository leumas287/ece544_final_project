# USAGE: Requires:  python 3+
#                   Opencv 3.2 ["import cv2"]
#                   internet connection 
#                   python urllib lib ["import urllib"]
#                   python numpy lib  ["import numpy" ]
#                   python os lib     ["import os"    ]
# Description:
# Python script pulls urls from http://www.image-net.org/.
# used to build training data fro custom built OpenCV Haar-classifiers.
# 
# File structure:
#    -positive_samples:  destination folder of positive training data
#    -negative samples:  destination folder of negative training data
#    -rejects:           destination folder of bad url downloads
# 
# USAGE:
#    Navigate to Image net and in search box enter the images desired. 
#    In the preceding page click on the "Downloads" link.
#    In the preceding page click on the "URLS" link
#    copy and past the sysnet # i.e n04255586", this is the link to your image category
#    In line # 74 replace the sysnet # with the contents of your clipboard
#    Run the script, making sure to comment out Line # 75
#    Bad urls will fill a portion of your destination folder, once script has finished running,
#    Copy and paste each type of bad URL into the "rejects" destination folder
#    Rerun the script uncommenting line #75 and commenting out Line # 74. This will remove all bad URL downloads.
